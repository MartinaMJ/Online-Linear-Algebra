    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "A very useful tool in physics and engineering is named Fourier Series. Essentially, it is a linear combination of sines and cossines that seeks to represent a periodic signal. Periodic signals are everywhere: the electrical energy that reaches our homes is a sinusoidal function, radio stations are usually identified by the frequency with which you must syncronise in order to listen. It is interesting, therefore, to represent such signals as sums of sines and cosines, since these are well known periodic functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "As it was said before, Fourier Series seeks to represent a periodic signal. A continuous signal is periodic if it obeys the following equation: $x(t)=x(t+T_0)$ , when  $T_0$  is its fundamental period. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is basic knowledge that every periodic function has a frequency, which is calculated with: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_0=\\frac{1}{T_0}  ,  w_0=2πf_0$$        \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiples of the values found with the formulas above are known as harmonics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, we know that a linear combination is a sum of elements (which may or may not be multiplied by scalars) that results in another element. The elements involved in such sum typically form a basis, which is sub-space in a vector space that spans the entire vector space and that constitutes solely of linearly independent vectors. This is exactly what we observe in Fourier Series: \n",
    "$$x(t)=a_0+\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n cos(n w_0 t) + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n sin(n w_0 t)$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that 1 (which multiplies $a_0$),  $sin(nw0t)$, $cos(nw0t)$  are linearly independent. \n",
    "You cannot obtain any of the three elements above simply by adding or multiplying the other elements by scalars. That means they constitute a basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let the following integral:  $\\int_{P} f(t)g(t) \\,dx$   For a period of time P. \n",
    "\n",
    "This integral is very interesting. If we apply it in the following situations: \n",
    "  $$ \\int_{P} cos(mt)cos(nt)dt = \\left\\{ \n",
    "    \\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "        \\pi,  m = n &\\\\\n",
    "        0,  m ≠ n\n",
    "    \\end{array} \n",
    "\\right. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\int_{P} sin(mt)sin(nt)dt = \\left\\{ \n",
    "    \\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "        \\pi,  m = n &\\\\\n",
    "        0,  m ≠ n\n",
    "    \\end{array} \n",
    "\\right.$$\n",
    "  $$\\int_{P} sin(mt)cos(nt) \\,dt = 0 $$ \n",
    "  $$\\int_{P} 1 \\,dt = 2\\pi $$\n",
    "  \n",
    " Dividing the result by P, we can see that the integral only returns 1 when the frequencies are the same for both sinusoids. For the value 1, it returns 2. Otherwise, it is always zero. Since sines and cosines are symmetric functions, if we apply the integral in the product between those functions and 1, we will also obtain zero. \n",
    " Analyzing it a little bit further, it is possible to associate this integral with an inner product. It is linear, symmetric and positive definite. \n",
    " We know that an inner product between two structures returns 0 when said structures are orthogonal. \n",
    " Thus, we prove that the basis used in Fourier Series is orthogonal, which makes everything much easier. \n",
    " In summary, the inner product in the integral between two functions through a period P, later divided by such period P.\n",
    "\n",
    " You might ask yourself how the coefficients that multiply the elements the basis are found. Once again, we use the inner product to define the coefficients: \n",
    "  $$a_0=\\frac{1}{P} \\int_{P}x(t)dt$$   $$a_n=\\frac{2}{P} \\int_{P}x(t)cos(n w_0 t)dt$$   $$bn=\\frac{2}{P}\\int_{P} x(t)sen(n w_0 t)dt$$  \n",
    " Generally speaking, the inner product reveals what two structures have in common. Therefore, the application above is a projection that reveals the similarity between the function that we intend to rewrite and the elements of the basis. That makes sense, because in order to construct a signal from a new basis, we need to know what the signal and that basis have in common. \n",
    " In order to find those coefficients, we choose the value P to be equal to that of the period of the signal x(t)."
